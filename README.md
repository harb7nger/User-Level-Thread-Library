## Overview

The project focuses on implementing basic thread library functionality, along with the relevant APIs for
the control of the threads that are created/deleted by the self-declared APIs. With the help of the
implemented APIs, basic Round-Robin scheduling is implemented in a preemptive fashion. Few test
cases are written to showcase the multithreaded nature of the code that is written with the help of a
few toy examples that showcase simple calculations.

The user-level thread library can replace the default pthread library for general use as it provides
similar functionalities

## APIs

#### 1. int uthread_create(void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);
Creates a thread. The main thread is created when this API is called for the first time. This is to
keep the context of the calling function. The state of the main thread will be RUNNING.
After that, a separate context is created for each thread. This includes a stack whose size is
4096 bytes, a stack pointer which will be pointing to the head of the stack and a program
counter pointing to the start_routine. The arguments are not passed to the routine. This
functionality is yet to be implemented.
It returns the thread ID.

#### 2. int uthread_init(int time_slice);
The input is the time slice the user would want to define for the thread that is being created.
Returns 0 by default, since it is a simple wrapper to initialize a struct. Sets the time slice in
milli-seconds. The time slice determines how often a thread is interrupted the timer interrupt
and put back into the ready queue by the scheduling logic.

#### 3. int uthread_yield(void);
This API puts the running thread in the READY state. It will then swap context to the next
thread chosen using the round-robin scheduling algorithm.

#### 4. int uthread_join(int tid, void **retval);
The API takes the ThreadID (tid) of the thread on which the current worker thread would want
to wait. Also sets the running threadâ€™s state to BLOCKED, places the TCB of the current thread
onto the blocked queue and switches context to the thread associated with the tid.
Returns 1 by default.
Returns 0 if the tid is invalid.

#### 5. int uthread_terminate(int tid);
The API moves the thread with thread ID tid to the finished queue. If it is the running thread
terminating, it will switch to a new thread based on round-robin scheduling.
Returns 1 after moving it to the finished queue.
Returns 0 if tid is invalid or if the ready queue is empty.

#### 6. int uthread_suspend(int tid);
The API changes the thread with thread ID tid to a suspended state. It will remain to stay in that
state until a uthread_resume is called.
Returns 1 after changing the state.
Returns 0 if tid is invalid or if the ready queue is empty.

#### 7. int uthread_resume(int tid);
The API puts the thread with thread ID tid to a ready state. It will continue executing the current
thread.
Return 1 after pushing it to the ready queue.
Return 0 if tid is invalid.

#### 8. int lock_init (lock_t*);
Initialize the lock variable to FREE.

#### 9. int acquire (lock_t*);
Implement a Test and Set atomic instruction to acquire the lock.
Returns only after the lock is acquired.

#### 10. int release (lock_t*);
Resets the lock back to FREE which enables other threads to acquire it.
Returns 1 by default.

## Customized APIs:

#### 1. void enableInterrupts(); & void disableInterrupts();
enableInterrupt sets the mask through sigemptyset. DisableInterrupt clears the mask that was
set. Both APIs do not take any inputs and have the return type void.

#### 2. void swapcontext(TCB* new_thread, TCB* old_thread);
The API takes the pointer to the TCB for a new thread, the thread to which we would want to
switch to an old thread, the pointer to the TCB from which we are going to switch from. It first
sets the timer as per the slice defined in uthread_init(). Sets the jmpbuf by calling sigsetjump
and sets the running thread pointer to the new thread TCB. After which it sets the state as
RUNNING and enables interrupts. When the PC returns after siglongjmp to the sigsetjump call,
the return value would be 1, implying that siglongjump is successful and enables interrupts.
The return type is void.

#### 3. TCB* getTCB(int tid);
The API Takes thread id as int. This looks through the running thread, blocked queue, ready
queue and finished queue to find the TCB associated with the tid passed to the wrapper.
Returns pointer to the TCB associated with the tid that is queried or returns NULL in the case
no corresponding TCB is found.

#### 4. void timer_handler(int sig);
The API takes the signal value to which the timer handler is listening on. At first, the API
disables interrupts. Pushes the running thread to the ready queue after setting its state to
READY.
If the ready queue is empty, it sets the timer so as to wait for any other thread to be created or
resumed. If the ready queue has a TCB to be scheduled, the TCB pointer is picked up and a
context switch is done to that thread. Returns void.


## README

### I. Tests:

#### 1. test_all_APIs.cpp:
Description - tests all APIs. The test does the following:
a. Spawns 10 threads
b. Thread 5 is suspended
c. Each thread increments a global variable after acquiring the lock
d. All threads (except 5) join the main thread after terminating themselves.
e. Thread 5 is resumed.
f. Thread 5 joins the main thread after completion
g. Print output

#### 2. test_array_sum.cpp:
Description - Computes the sum of an array by spawning given number of threads. The test
does the following:
a. Accepts number of threads as an argument
b. Generates an integer array with random numbers
c. Spawns n threads
d. Each thread reads one array element and updates the sum after acquiring the lock
e. All threads join the main thread after terminating themselves
f. Print output

#### 3. test_lock.cpp
Description - Tests lock. The test does the following:
a. Accepts number of threads as an argument
b. Each thread increments a global variable after acquiring a lock. (Thread releases lock
after update)
c. All threads join the main thread after terminating themselves
d. Print output

#### 4. test_suspend_resume.cpp
Description - Tests suspend and resume. The test does the following:
a. Spawns 10 threads
b. Each thread increments a global variable after acquiring lock. (Thread releases lock
after update)
c. All threads join the main thread after terminating themselves
d. Print output

### II. Steps to build the tests:

Within the src directory.

`make all`  Builds all tests 

`make test_name`  Builds the particular test

`make clean`    Deletes the object files for all tests

### III. Steps to run the tests:

Within the src directory post make.

`./all_api`   Runs test_all_APIs.cpp (10 threads)

`./array_sum <num_threads>`   Runs test_array_sum.cpp   (Accepts number of threads as argument (default 10))

`./lock_test <num_threads>`   Runs test_lock.cpp    (Accepts number of threads as argument (default 10))

`./suspend_test`    Runs test_suspend_resume.cpp (10 threads)
